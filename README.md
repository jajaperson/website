# [jaj•a•person's website](https://jajaperson.now.sh)

yup, i finally made a website. it's completely overengineered for the
minimalistic single page it is, but maybe i'll eventually add a blog or
something.

## what i'm using

in case you were wondering, here are the tools the site uses. as i said,
overengineered.

- [`typescript`](https://typescriptlang.org) — makes javascript cooler
- [`nextjs`](http://nextjs.org) — uWu server side rendering
- [`react`](https://reactjs.org) — components and stuff
- [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com) — styles the components
  \*gasp\*
- [`fontawesome`](https://fontawesome.com) — icons and stuff; i mainly used for
  social icons
- [`prettier`](https://prettier.io) — makes code look fancy
- [`eslint`](https://eslint.org) — for when i make mistakes
- [`now.sh`](https://now.sh) — hosts the website _and_ automatically builds and
  hosts previews for commits and pull requests
- [`github actions`](https://github.com/features/actions) — an elegant ci and
  workflow automation solution built right into github
- [`dependabot`](https://dependabot.com) — a friendly robot who helps keep all
  my dependencies up to date

## why is all this readme lowercase

to be edgy.
